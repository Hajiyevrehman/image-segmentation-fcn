# PyTorch Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project implements and trains FCN-32s and FCN-8s models for image segmentation using PyTorch. It includes the following components:

1. FCN-32s Implementation and Training
   - Implementation from scratch
   - Training from scratch
   - Training with pretrained parameters

2. FCN-8s Implementation and Training
   - Implementation
   - Training with pretrained parameters

3. Analysis and Questions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook

### Dataset Preparation

To download the required dataset, run the following command in your terminal:

bash get_dataset.sh


## Running the Project

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:

2. Navigate to and open  .

3. Run through the cells in the notebook to implement the models, train them, and analyze the results.

## Implementation Details

The notebook guides you through:
1. Implementing FCN-32s and FCN-8s architectures
2. Training procedures for both models
3. Using pretrained parameters
4. Analyzing and comparing results

## Usage Tips

- Run all code cells in the notebook sequentially.
- The notebook includes inline questions. Provide your answers in the designated areas.
- Ensure all results, including accuracies, are visible in the notebook.

## Exporting Results

To export the notebook as a PDF:
1. Go to File > Download as > PDF via LaTeX (.pdf)
2. Ensure all cells have been executed and results are visible before exporting.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Export the completed notebook as a PDF, including all results and answers.
2. Create a ZIP file containing all source files (excluding the dataset).
3. Submit both the PDF and ZIP file to the designated submission platform.

## Notes

- Remove any debugging logs before submission.
- Ensure you've addressed all questions and tasks in the notebook.
- Do not include the downloaded dataset in your submission.
