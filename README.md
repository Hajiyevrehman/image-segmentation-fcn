# PyTorch Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project implements and trains FCN-32s and FCN-8s models for image segmentation using PyTorch. It includes the following components:

1. FCN-32s Implementation and Training
   - Implementation from scratch
   - Training from scratch
   - Training with pretrained parameters

2. FCN-8s Implementation and Training
   - Implementation
   - Training with pretrained parameters

3. Analysis and Questions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook

### Dataset Preparation

To download the required dataset, run the following command in your terminal:

bash get_dataset.sh


## Running the Project

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:

2. Navigate to and open  .

3. Run through the cells in the notebook to implement the models, train them, and analyze the results.

## Implementation Details

The notebook guides you through:
1. Implementing FCN-32s and FCN-8s architectures
2. Training procedures for both models
3. Using pretrained parameters
4. Analyzing and comparing results

## Usage Tips

- Run all code cells in the notebook sequentially.
- The notebook includes inline questions. Provide your answers in the designated areas.
- Ensure all results, including accuracies, are visible in the notebook.



## Support
